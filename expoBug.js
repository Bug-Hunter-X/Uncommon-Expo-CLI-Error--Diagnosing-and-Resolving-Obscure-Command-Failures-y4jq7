This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to manage an Expo project.  It's not a typical error and often stems from inconsistencies within the project's configuration files or conflicts with other installed packages. The error message itself might be vague, providing little insight into the root cause, such as a generic 'Error: Command failed' or similar.
